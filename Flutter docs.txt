Lecture 136
My own note:
In Flutter, either start with 'StatelessWidget' or use 'MaterialApp' wrapper in 'build' method


MediaQuery vs LayoutBuilder:
The main difference between Media Query and Layout Builder is that Media Query is based on the full context of the screen rather than just the size of a particular widget; 
on the other hand, Layout Builder determines the maximum width and height of a specific widget only.


Flutter Internals Project:
try to make the statefulWidget as small as possible to improve the performance of the device.
because for each UI update will call Build method.


each screen need to set its own Scaffold widget
