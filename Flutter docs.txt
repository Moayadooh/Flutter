private class or data type start with "_"

"StatelessWidget" used for static user interface
"StatefulWidget" used for dynamic user interface

foreach in dart:
...objectName.List<object>.map((item){})
shuffled

'widget' is a key word to access properties of the extended class. It is an instance of that class.

'Map<String, Object>' is a key and value data type like a dictionary

'myValue' is data type act as method
int get myValue {
	return 1;
}

var x = myValue;

'showDialog()' --> show a modal
'Navigator.pop(ctx);' --> close the modal

value! --> exclamation mark mean value will not be null

'Spacer()' --> similar to margin-right, margin-left, margin-top, margin-bottom: auto;
'const SizedBox(height: 16),' --> similar to margin-top and margin-bottom
'const SizedBox(width: 16),' --> similar to margin-right and margin-left

Lecture 136
My own note:
In Flutter, either start with 'StatelessWidget' or use 'MaterialApp' wrapper in 'build' method

MaterialApp:
provides a default implementation of Material Design.

Scaffold:
height --> max device height
width --> max device width

Container:
Use a Container when you want to add padding, margins, borders, or background color, to name some of its capabilities.

Expanded:
take only available width and height
fix issue of infinity width or height

Column:
height --> as much as possible
width --> as much as needed by children

Row:
height --> as much as needed by children
width --> as much as possible

TextField:
width --> as much as possible


MediaQuery vs LayoutBuilder:
The main difference between Media Query and Layout Builder is that Media Query is based on the full context of the screen rather than just the size of a particular widget; 
on the other hand, Layout Builder determines the maximum width and height of a specific widget only.


Flutter Internals Project:
try to make the statefulWidget as small as possible to improve the performance of the device.
because for each UI update will call Build method.
